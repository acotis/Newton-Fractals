Last commit: Fix text on buttons (again).

Tasks for sidebar branch:
    Next commit: Create hierarchy in control panel.
    Next commit: Move root-count and colors to a new FractalSettings class.
    Next commit: Make a root-count picker (maybe a slider?).
    Next commit: Add buttons for switching from one resolution to another.
    Next commit: Make an on-screen color picker?

Next up: Implement save-settings and load-fractal functionality.
Next up: Make the zeros drag-able?
Next commit: Make it be able to take the coefficients of the terms of the polynomial, not just the roots
    (Probably pull polynomial functionality out into a class with methods:
        Polynomial(vector<Complex>) // Construct from zeros
        Polynomial(vector<pair<Complex,int>) // Construct from terms
        getDerivative()
        evaluateAt(Complex))

Bugs:
    Program sometimes segfaults (?) on close.
    Smoothness isn't entirely smooth.
