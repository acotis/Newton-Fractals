Last commit: Make pushed-down resolution buttons not do anything when clicked again.

Commits for root-picker branch:

    Next commit: Make a root-count picker (maybe a slider?).


Upcoming features branches:
    + Color picker (how to design it intuitively?)
    + Checkboxes for smoothness and dark theme

Commits for cleanup branch:
    Next commit: Separate GUI-generation into two new files: a constants file and a control-panel generation file.
    Next commit: Change FractalCanvas.saveToPNG() to use image.create(width, height, pixels)?
    Next commit: Make ClickablePanels resize to accommodate components automatically?
        (Also implement a setMargin() method)


Eventual commits:
    Next up: Implement save-fractal and load-fractal functionality?
    Next up: Make the zeros drag-able?
    Next commit: Make it be able to take the coefficients of the terms of the polynomial, not just the roots
        (Probably pull polynomial functionality out into a class with methods:
            Polynomial(vector<Complex>) // Construct from zeros
            Polynomial(vector<pair<Complex,int>) // Construct from terms
            getDerivative()
            evaluateAt(Complex))

Bugs:
    Program sometimes segfaults (?) on close.
    Fractal smoothness isn't entirely smooth.
    Some button-texts show up fuzzy.
