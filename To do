+ Add buttons for switching from one resolution to another
+ Make an on-screen color picker
+ Make the zeros drag-able
+ Make it be able to take the coefficients of the terms of the polynomial, not just the roots
    (Probably pull polynomial functionality out into a class with methods:
        Polynomial(vector<Complex>) // Construct from zeros
        Polynomial(vector<pair<Complex,int>) // Construct from terms
        getDerivative()
        evaluateAt(Complex))

Bugs:
    Program sometimes segfaults (?) on close.
