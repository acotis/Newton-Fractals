Last commit: Make re-draws stop old draws.

Tasks for sidebar branch:
    Next commit: Make resolution button functional (add setImageSize to FractalCanvas class)
    Next commit: Refactor FractalCanvas to have just one center for resetting width and height.
    Next commit: Make drawFractal() draw a black line in front of it so the drawing is visible.

    (Next up: Change FractalCanvas.saveToPNG() to use image.create(width, height, pixels)?)

    Next commit: Make ClickablePanels resize to accommodate components automatically?
        (Also implement a setMargin() method)
    Next commit: Move root-count and colors to a FractalSettings
    Next commit: Make an on-screen color picker?
    Next commit: Make a root-count picker (maybe a slider?).

    Eventual commit: Separate GUI-generation into two new files: a constants file and a control-panel generation file.


Next up: Implement save-settings and load-fractal functionality.
Next up: Make the zeros drag-able?
Next commit: Make it be able to take the coefficients of the terms of the polynomial, not just the roots
    (Probably pull polynomial functionality out into a class with methods:
        Polynomial(vector<Complex>) // Construct from zeros
        Polynomial(vector<pair<Complex,int>) // Construct from terms
        getDerivative()
        evaluateAt(Complex))

Bugs:
    Program sometimes segfaults (?) on close.
    Fractal smoothness isn't entirely smooth.
    Some button-texts show up fuzzy.
